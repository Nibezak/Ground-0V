    The primary goal is to create a comprehensive and educational video of **at least 4 minutes (aim for 6-8+ minutes with this detailed structure)**. Be expansive in your explanations and provide rich, detailed content for every scene to meet this length requirement.
    **Crucially, to achieve the target video duration, the narration script planned for each scene and sub-component must be substantial and detailed. Avoid overly concise phrasing; aim for comprehensive explanations that naturally fill the allocated times.**
    Plan a manim animation video to explain the concept. 
Break it down into **10-20 detailed scenes** that comprehensively cover the topic, following this structure:

Create a dynamic, engaging question display system with the following features:

Every scene should have a various of animations and transitions to keep the user engaged, the more animation per scene the better

Pop-Up Animations  Parts of the question or keywords should pop up dynamically to draw user attention, possibly using spring or bounce effects.

Multiple Display Styles  Don't limit the display to one animation or layout. Vary the presentation using:

Fade-ins

Sliding transitions

Zoom effects

Highlighted callouts

3D Visual Integration  Any concepts or structures referenced in the question (e.g. "spheres", "graphs", "pyramids", "houses", etc.) should be visually rendered in interactive 3D.

For example:

A “pyramid” should appear as a 3D model with depth and perspective.

A “graph” should rise up in 3D, with animated nodes and edges.

A “house” could appear as a rotatable 3D object, perhaps with clickable rooms.

Adaptive Layout The display should adapt to the structure of the question:

Logical relationships → Graphs or flowcharts.

Hierarchies → Pyramids or tree structures.

Spatial concepts → 3D maps or models.

if you circle a text make sure the circle is big enough for the text to fit in it

the text should be very clear and visible

Same with any other transition , it should be fast, because slow is boring

and engaging. Use the following structure for each scene:

Immersive Transitions when moving between segments of the question or multiple questions, use spatial transitions (e.g., camera pans, 3D flips, zooms).

1. INTRODUCTION (30-45 seconds):
   - Introduce the concept with a clear title
   - Use a visual metaphor or real-world example to establish context
   - End with a clear question or statement about what will be explained
   - **Narration Guidance**: The narration should provide a comprehensive overview, touching upon the concept's importance, real-world relevance, and any necessary background. Aim for a thorough and engaging setup.

2. CORE CONCEPT - PART 1 (45-75 seconds):
   - Focus on the first fundamental aspect or component of the main topic.
   - Specify visual elements, transformations, and exact narration.
   - **Narration Guidance**: Provide an in-depth explanation: define the component, explain its purpose, how it works, and its relationship to the overall concept. Cover several sub-points to ensure clarity.

3. EXAMPLE FOR PART 1 (30-60 seconds):
   - Show a clear, practical example illustrating Core Concept - Part 1.
   - Specify visual elements, transformations, and exact narration.
   - **Narration Guidance**: Detail a step-by-step walkthrough of the example, explaining its setup, the process, observations, and outcome. Make it comprehensive.

4. CORE CONCEPT - PART 2 (45-75 seconds):
   - Focus on the second fundamental aspect or component.
   - (Similar detail requirements as Part 1)
   - **Narration Guidance**: Similar in-depth explanation as Part 1, ensuring this component is also thoroughly explored.

5. EXAMPLE FOR PART 2 (30-60 seconds):
   - Show a clear, practical example illustrating Core Concept - Part 2.
   - (Similar detail requirements as Example for Part 1)
   - **Narration Guidance**: Similar detailed walkthrough as the first example.

6. CORE CONCEPT - PART 3 (Optional, if concept complexity warrants it) (45-75 seconds):
   - Focus on a third fundamental aspect, or a more advanced/nuanced part of the topic.
   - (Similar detail requirements as Part 1 & 2)
   - **Narration Guidance**: If the topic has a third key component, explain it with the same depth. If not, this scene can be used to explore interconnections or a related advanced topic.

7. COMPREHENSIVE APPLICATION / CASE STUDY (60-90 seconds):
   - Showcase a larger, more complex example or case study that integrates multiple aspects of the concept discussed.
   - Demonstrate a real-world application or a problem-solving scenario.
   - **Narration Guidance**: This should be a rich, detailed example. Explain the context, how different parts of the concept are applied, and the significance of the outcome. Walk through the application step-by-step.

8. COMMON CHALLENGES / MISCONCEPTIONS (30-60 seconds):
   - Address 1-2 common misunderstandings, difficulties, or pitfalls related to the concept.
   - Provide clarifications and tips to avoid them.
   - **Narration Guidance**: Clearly articulate the misconception/challenge, explain why it occurs, and provide a clear, detailed correction or guidance.

9. BROADER IMPLICATIONS / FUTURE SCOPE (Optional) (30-45 seconds):
   - Discuss the wider impact of the concept, its connections to other fields, or potential future developments.
   - **Narration Guidance**: Offer a thought-provoking perspective on the concept's significance beyond its immediate definition.

10. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION (45-60 seconds):
    - Recap the key components, examples, and main takeaways from all preceding scenes.
    - Reinforce the overall understanding.
    - End with a strong concluding statement or a thought-provoking question.
    - **Narration Guidance**: The summary should be comprehensive, tying together all major points from the extended explanation. The conclusion should be impactful and not rushed.

For EACH scene, provide:
- Specific visual elements to include
- Exact narration text
- Transitions between scenes
- Color schemes and visual style notes
